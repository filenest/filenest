## What it does

Hosting files externally? Filenest can help you manage them without leaving your app.  
You don't need a CMS to manage assets. Just connect a third party provider
and build your custom UI using unstyled components.

- ðŸ”‹ Connect a third party file storage provider.
- ðŸ”Œ Integrate into your existing API (e.g. Next.js / tRPC).
- ðŸŽ¨ Unstyled React components for your frontend UI.

## Use cases

- **Media Library**: Manage images, videos, documents and other files.
- **Form Fields**: Easily get file URLs for form submissions to store them in your DB.
- **Custom UI**: Build your own file manager with your own design.
- **All in one**: No more switching tabs between your app and cloud storage provider.

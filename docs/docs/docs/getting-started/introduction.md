# Introduction

## What is Filenest and Who is it For

Filenest is a TypeScript library designed to seamlessly integrate a file manager into your app or admin dashboard. This library is ideal for developers who:
- Need to connect a file hosting provider to their app
- Require a way to select images for database entities (e.g., articles)
- Want to manage files directly within their site

## Background

Developers often choose to build their own admin dashboards instead of using a CMS for various reasons. Even when creating a simple blog backend, you may need to view, select, or manage images and other files — like selecting a header image for a blog article.

While it's possible to use a simple text field to paste an image link, having a fully-featured media gallery, like those found in content management systems, offers a better user experience. However, implementing such functionality can be tedious and time-consuming.

Filenest significantly reduces the effort required to build these features. By using providers and adapters for your backend and frontend components for your UI, you can easily integrate Filenest’s asset management capabilities into your existing project. This approach allows you to maintain full control over backend permissions and frontend styles.

# Cloudinary Provider

How to set up Cloudinary as a data source.

## 1. Install dependencies

<PackageManagerTabs command="install @filenest/core @filenest/provider-cloudinary"/>

## 2. Initialize the provider

Only create and use a provider server-side. Never expose your API keys to the frontend.

You can find your Cloudinary credentials in the [Cloudinary Console](https://console.cloudinary.com/users/login).

```ts title="some/backend/path/filenest.ts"
import { Cloudinary } from "@filenest/provider-cloudinary"

export const provider = new Cloudinary({
    API_KEY: "YourAPIKey",
    API_SECRET: "YourAPISecret",
    CLOUD_NAME: "YourCloudName",
})
```

Next, you'll need to [set up an adapter](/docs/getting-started/quick-start.html#2-configure-an-adapter) to connect the provider to your API.

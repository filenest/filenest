# Next.js Adapter

How to set up API routes for Filenest in a Next.js app.

## 1. Install dependencies

<PackageManagerTabs command="install @filenest/core @filenest/adapter-nextjs"/>

## 2. Create a route handler

The Next.js adapter only works with route handlers inside the app directory.

Create the following file structure:

```
app
└── api
    └── media
        └── [action]
            └── route.ts
```

Then just initialize the adapter inside the `route.ts` file and pass it a provider.

```ts title="app/api/media/[action]/route.ts"
import { initNextjsAdapter } from "@filenest/adapter-nextjs"
import { Cloudinary } from "@filenest/provider-cloudinary"

const provider = new Cloudinary({...})

export const { POST } = initNextjsAdapter({ provider })
```

Now you're all set to build your UI. Check out the [minimal setup](/docs/frontend/minimal-setup) to get started.

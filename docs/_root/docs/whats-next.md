# What's Next

## Current State of Filenest

As is currently stands, Filenest only includes limited providers and adapters. This is because Filenest was initially designed for my ([@nordowl](https://github.com/nordowl)) specific personal use case, which is to manage Cloudinary assets in a Next.js application, as written in the [introduction](/docs/getting-started/introduction.html#the-story-behind-it).
However, I want to make sure Filenest can be used by a wider range of developers, which is why I already have a few features in mind I'd like to implement at some point.

## Planned Features

With help from the community, the following features will possibly be implemented into Filenest.

### Providers

Filenest needs your help porting the React components to other popular frontend frameworks.

Creating those components is a big task - if you would like to port Filenest's React components to another ecosystem, please [create a new issue](https://github.com/filenest/filenest/issues) and let's talk about it.

- Vue
